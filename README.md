# American Eagle Website Design Clone

This project is a react-based clone of the American Eagle website design (https://www.americaneagle.com/). It replicates the core structure, layout, and UI components of the original site for learning purposes and UI development practice.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to understand and implement the features, responsive design, and visual aesthetics of the American Eagle website using React.js. It focuses on modular React components, clean styling (CSS or Tailwind), and client-side routing to mimic the browsing experience.

## Features

- Responsive homepage with hero sections, product categories, banners, and featured content
- Navigation bar with dropdown menus similar to the original site
- Footer with links and social media icons
- Multiple reusable components like Header, Footer, Hero, About, Contact, Expertise sections
- Clean, modern UI styling using CSS modules or utility-first CSS (Tailwind CSS)
- Functional links and navigation powered by React Router (if implemented)
- Image assets optimized for fast loading and crisp display

## Technologies Used

- React.js (Functional Components and Hooks)
- React Router DOM (optional for client-side navigation)
- Tailwind CSS or standard CSS
- Vite or Create React App for build tooling
- Git for version control
